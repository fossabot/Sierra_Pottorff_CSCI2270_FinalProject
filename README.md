# Sierra_Pottorff_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
We will be implementing a program that will organize basketball team’s information 
using hash tables. Each team will be established with their names, win/lose ration, 
ranking and its roster. Once teams are added to the table we will begin to update 
their wins and loses accordingly. Once we have enough teams in the data structure 
we will be able to rank individual teams according to their streak. We will be able 
to simulate games using roster line ups and each player’s performance level.

How to Run:
Download the Assembled/Final folder.  You can find the HashTable.cpp file in src folder, the HashTable.h file in the include and the main.cpp in the folder.  To run the project open the Final.cbp file in Code::Blocks. It should open and include all the needed files.  IF not open and include the HashTable.cpp and HashTable.h in the porject and the porject will compile and run.
